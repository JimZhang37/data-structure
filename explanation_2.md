# Why I choose this data structure
I use python list to store the list of sub folders inside a folder.

# Time Complexity
I used a for loop for a list has O(n).
I also used the recursion by calling the function itself.
I think the time complexity is still O(n) because all folders or sub folders are visited only once.
