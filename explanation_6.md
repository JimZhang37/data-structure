# Why I choose this data structure
I use python's set in this project

# Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(n)
I used for loop to add items in lists to the set, so all inputs will be visited once.
The union and intersection operation of set have O(min(len(set1), len(set2))).
So in total, the time complexity is still O(n)
